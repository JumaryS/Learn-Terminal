# The basics

     * lets start with making a directory in your terminal by using mkdir (make directory)
     *  name it what ever you want 
     *  now lets access your newly made directory by using cd (change directory)
     * cd (name of file) then press enter
     * once you are in your new directory we can start creating files within by using the word (touch)
